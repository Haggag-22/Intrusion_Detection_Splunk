# Intrusion Detection with Splunk

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing indicators of compromise (IoCs) within a network environment using Sysmon and Splunk. It aims to identify suspicious activities related to command and control (C2) servers, process behaviors, and the initial infection vectors that could compromise security.
